		<p class='animateText'>I am bright, ambitious and self-motivated thinker who has a keen interest in all things related to the Internet and new technologies. I graduate Studies of Biotechnology with master degree, but I had always strong connection to work with computer software and  have an intense desire to learn how to work with webs core. In the past year I was looking  for opportunity to start learn programming. Unfortunately, during my work time it was not possible. At the beginning of this year I decided to devote all my time and energy to learn web development. I am a self directed and self managed person who is always pushing himself to deliver ongoing process improvements in anything he does. Right now Iâ€™m looking for suitable position that will allow me to learn as much as possible.</p>
